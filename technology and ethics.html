                <div class="lead">&nbsp; Technology is taking the place of ethics gradually. In This generation we rely more on technology than God, our ethics and believes. In the western world today the rate at which young people are committing suicide is on the rise on daily basis. You see, what we don’t know is that technology makes us feel lonelier than ever. We need to give room to God, ethics, precepts of life and the laws of nature. We are not saying technology is bad, but how you use the technology at your disposal is what we are trying to point out here.<div>&nbsp; Technology has affected our MESH in a way that we seems not to be in control of our daily happenings again. Many youths involved in drug abuse were introduced to the act through the media such as, music videos, songs, movies etc.</div><div>The emotional state of many youth is not balanced as a result of what they have seen and heard. In the area of seen, the major contributor is pornography. It will interest you to know that, pornographic sites are the most visited sites in the world. When you log into a pornographic site all your details are there, even the ip address of your phone.</div><div><br></div></div>
