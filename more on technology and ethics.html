                <div class="lead">Most people don’t know that they can be addicted to pornography without even knowing. What pornography does is, it impairs your ability to visualize things, it prevents your mind from seeing clearly, it also blocks your mind from having future plans. As an addict to pornography the only thing that comes to mind is SEX. Someone once said “I watch porn to pass time”, that is how serious it can be.<div>&nbsp; Music is the soul of man that is it affects your inner being; it penetrates into your deepest emotions. Music can break your heart and mold it and that is why music is so revered in the world today. The music you listen to is very important because it affects the way you think. Music is like someone telling you what to do in a melodious way, the truth is you fantasize what you hear and music is a major contributor to that. your life is following a pattern, a pattern you created for yourself by listening to your kind of music. Yes, that is what they call it “my kind of music”. For example, if you are a fan of love songs you will find yourself entangled with so many love issues. Those of us who love gangster related songs; if you are not a gangster already then gangsterism is not far from you. You see, it molds your mind towards the lyrics of the songs.</div><div>As for the ladies who love listening to heart break kind of songs, trusting someone with your heart becomes very difficult. The question is, what kind of music are you listening to?</div><div>Technological advancement has made it easy for young lads to betray what they believe in. when I was young I was taught to work hard in order to be successful. Well these days’ people are looking for every means to get rich as quickly as possible, but the truth is there is no good or genuine shortcut to wealth, except investment. Investment in education, business etc.</div><div>&nbsp; One other thing is online theft. Online theft is so common these days that, young guys are willing to dupe their paddy to get rich. A friend of yours will tell you to invest in an online Ponzi scheme, PH 5k to get 10k that is give 5k to get 10k in return, unknown to the friend that he’s the one running the Ponzi scheme. Well that is what technology can do, it kills your humanity.</div><div>&nbsp; So many Nigerians lost their lives during the advent of MMM Nigeria. What killed them was the get rich without hard work mentality, not MMM. Why? Because they trusted technology more than ethics. On what planet can you give 30k to get 50k without any investment, that is what greed can do to you.</div><div>&nbsp; What we should know is that, there can never be success without hard work. If you are a student and you don’t read, you will fail (laws of nature) there is no magic. Well some student’s will say “we go block the lecturer’s nah” but remember the journey of a thousand miles begins with a step. “nah just this one course nah” that was how Johnson started and now he’s blocking all his courses.</div><div>&nbsp; Don’t live, move and breath on technology, use it when necessary because if you do, it will take your time so much that you will not have time for yourself and this in turn damages your MESH.</div><div><br></div></div>
