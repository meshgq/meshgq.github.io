                <div class="lead">&nbsp;The rate at which people are committing suicide is alarming, especially in Bayelsa. This is what happens when you have a shaky MESH state. It might not necessarily be suicide.<div>&nbsp;But people don't just commit suicide, it's not premeditated it just happens when frustrations, depression, mental illness, low self esteem, failures, disappointment etc starts to loom in.</div><div> </div><div><br></div><div>When we hear about someone that committed suicide, the only thing that comes into our mind is "that person nah mumu o, for this sweet life" I'm a victim of that, big time. That person too might have said something of that sort some other time, and yet when trials and temptation came the outcome was still the same. Let me give some breathtaking suicides that actually happened in Bayelsa last year 2016.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div> &nbsp;1. A 32 year old man committed suicide at Ikolo in Yenagoa Bayelsa state by drinking sniper</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;REASON: his wife was having an affair</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. An 18 year old girl committed suicide in  Amarata Yenagoa Bayelsa state</div><div>&nbsp; </div><div>&nbsp; REASON: she was forced into an uncompleted building at gun point, and was raped by three guys.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; 3. An engineer who works at Bayelsa state water board, married with kids took his life when his wife left him after he had suffered stroke for 12 months.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; </div><div>REASON: Non payment of salary. Which led to the stroke</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div> &nbsp;DISCUSSION:&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; </div><div>1. What advice can you give if someone comes to you with issues relating to any of these cases.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>2.  these incidents were they premeditated? or they just happend?</div><div><br></div></div>
