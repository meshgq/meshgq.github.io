Notice the use of the word CHRONIC. Chronic as used in this context is talking about a prolonged period of time, that is a problem that reoccures for a prolonged period of time. So therefore alcoholism is a prolonged or reoccuring disease caused by addiction to alcohol. Alcoholism is a disease, it eats you up like cancer. So the more you get involved in alcohols the more your alcoholic state worsen.</div><div>&nbsp; Whenever  alcoholism is mentioned anywere, what comes to our mind is the physical effects, such as dizziness, vomiting, talking out of terms, violence e.t.c. that is, the effects that are visible to the eye. The effects of alcoholism goes beyond the visible ones, there are severe effects to alcohlism such as the mental effects(ME) and this is what we will be discussing. Remember we’ve talked about our mental state and how to keep it in check, I strongly believe we did say something on alcohols too. So you can visit our site to read more on MENTAL STATE(MS).</div><div><br></div><div>*ALCOHOLISM AND HOW IT CAN AFFECTS YOU MENTALLY*</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Alcoholism has psycological effects too, it can affect your mental state aside the physical effects. There is no justification to the amount of alcohol you drink. There is nothing like “nah once once I dey drink oh” or “nah for flexing days only oh”. Alcohol is alcohol, if you like take a drop it still has effects on your mental state(MS). It’s amazing the way young people nowadays drinks and smokes. You will see young boys and girls drinking and smoking away their lives gradually, a friend of mine said “ look at them, they are walking to their graves slowly unknown to them”. In Nigeria is called flexing, “ oboy see flexing”. Well as for the smoking is a discussion for another day.</div><p></p></div>
