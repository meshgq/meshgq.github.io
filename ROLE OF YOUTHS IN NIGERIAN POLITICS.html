                <div class="lead"><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><p><strong><em>#SAY_NO_TO_POLITICAL_SLAVERY</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>#WE(YOUTHS)_ARE_THE_KINGMAKERS</em></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">The world is no longer asleep, and people have decided to take matters into their own hands. There is a growing mentality in the Nigerian youths that is so disturbing. We (youths) are todays hope, we are not the future of tomorrow, it’s our time. We are not going to die in silence like our fathers did, we have a voice and we are going to use it.</span><br></p><p>In every nation, the population of the youths far exceeds every other age group. But in Nigeria we are behaving like the minority. There is this mentality of selling our votes for a token to politicians, but what we don’t know is that in selling our votes we are actually selling our birthrights, opinions, and our voice. The most painful part of it is that we are selling it for a little token, say 20,000 naira. &nbsp;</p><p>Look at what we are facing today because of our decision, 20k cannot feed you for even a month. We have to start thinking about our future today don’t allow them to deceive you with that little money, you are worth more than that, it’s an insult. That money that you are been given was supposed to be paid into your account on monthly basis if the right person was elected.</p><p>Over the years I have heard boys saying “ him don forget us nah, no be we shoot gun for am for that election.” Why him no go forget you? When you yourself you don’t even know your worth. The truth is you are just a tool in his hands. Most of these politicians their families are not even in this country, and if they are in this country they are living in comfortable places like banana island, wuse Abuja, Ibarra and so on. Don’t trade your life and the future of your born and unborn children for a penny. Don’t belittle yourself; you have something to offer no matter who you are. Let them give the guns to their children if it’s the right thing to do.</p><p>What we don’t know is this; we have become slaves to our own mistakes. Politics in this country is now a family business. The house of assembly member will send his children to the best universities in the world with our money to study, and when they return they will start their political careers were their father stopped and so on and so forth. Since the inception of Bayelsa state till date, there hasn’t been any change of government officials, they are just moving from one political position to another. From a senator to a commissioner, from a commissioner to SSA so on and so forth.</p></div>
