Everything great started small, you might be saying it’s just one glass but remenber it’s drops of water that makes an ocean. Many youths don’t know that highness is the same thing as drunkenness, if you drink and get high always you are a drunkard( someone who is habitually drunk). “oboy I just high like anyhow, I no even know myself” don’t worry one day you will miss the road to your house. If you have plans and vision for your life, alcoholism will never be an issue to you.</div><div>&nbsp; Lets take a peek at some of the effects of alcoholism…</div><div><br></div><div>•	you experience feelings of nervousness, that is you become nervous for no reason at all.</div><div>•	Alcoholism can make you sad and depressed.

Emotional instability can cause great damage to your mental state.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>**WHAT ALCOHOLISM CAN DO**</div><div><br></div><div>•	Debra R said “ I really need help for my husband. He drinks and wants to attack me. Mostly verbally( lack of self control) but the other night he drew a knife at me ( violence) I was scared to death. But the next day he acts like nothing happened”.</div><div>Ladies who are into a relationship with a guy that cannot go to the bathroom without taking a sip, Is like committing suicide. One thing we should know is that anyone given to alcohol cannot control their emotions whenever they are under the influence of alcohol. It’s like hard drugs that knocks your brain out of balance, it takes control of your brain stimuli, it controls your actions.</div><div>•	blackout and memory slips: Alcohol produce impairments( weakening or disability) in memory.

If you try to force anyone, it may be your spouse, friend relative or even brother or sister, from taking alcohol it will not work you just have to talk to them about it intimately.</div><div>&nbsp; Several people will recommend seeing a doctor, but what you need is talking to supportive people, except for severe cases. If your friends are all alcoholics then you need to change them. Like they say, show me your friend and I will tell you who you are.</div><div>&nbsp; Try as much as you can to stay around people who talks about reasonable things rather than drinking and clubing. You cannot be a clubist and not involed with alcohols.</div><div><br></div><div>FOOD FOR THOUGHT</div><div>1.	Just imagine if president Buhari is an alcoholic.</div><div><br></div><div>2.	prof. Yemi Osibanjo is always high( drunk).</div><div><br></div><div>That is to say, if you want to be great there are certain things you &nbsp;just can’t do and one of them is taking alcohol. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div></div>
