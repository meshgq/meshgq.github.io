                <div class="lead">&nbsp; What are emotions: emotions are positive or negative experiences that are associated with a particular pattern of physiological activity.<div>Your mental state is perceptive to your emotional state at any point in time. Your emotional state controls your actions wether good or bad. If emotions are allowed to lie in shallow grounds, uncontrolled, not catered for, there will be a dominance of wrong and bad choices.</div><div>It is important to note that your ES indirectly affects your behaviour. Research has shown that as we mature we are less likely to act out of emotions. In other words emotional actions are more dominant in the life of the younger generation.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; </div><div>&nbsp; There is a little difference between emotional state and feelings. We have feelings that aren't emotions. For example i can feel hot, cold ,energetic. It is  only when we interpret these feelings that we have emotions.  Where does interpretation occure? In the mind of course. so you see, if your mental state is not properly structured, your emotional state will fumble.  You need a good MENTAL STATE(MS) to achieve a proper EMOTIONAL STATE (ES).</div><div>&nbsp; </div><div>&nbsp; When you have a good emotional state it gives you the right informations, because emotions can produce information. For instance fear is an information about threat. Many people have decided to live in this world without emotions, they think that the logical world is less painful and more practical without emotions.</div><div><br></div><div>~~How ES affect learning, behaviour, and relationship~~</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; We need allnof our emotions for thinking, problem solving and focused attention. In order for us to learn anything our minds must be focused and our emotions needs to feel balanced.</div><div>Most people don't know that every and any process of life has to so much to do with learning. You learn to love people, you learn to live with people, you learn to adopt to environmental changes and so on.</div><div>&nbsp; Many people experience heartbreaks because of their rough and in balanced emotional states. Heartbreaks is not just when your boyfriend or girlfriend, husband or wife decides to call it a quite, but heartbreaks can come from any angle, it can come from your friends, your mum, your dad, and even your siblings. It pop out from any where and at anytime. How you deal with it solely depends on how properly you've guided your emotions, because things like this will definitely affect your behaviour, and how you handle future relationships.</div><div>Problems of poor ES</div><div><br></div><div>1. Poor ES can affect your mental state negatively.  A negative ES produces fear, anxiety, depression, hate, regret, death (suicide) etc.</div><div><br></div><div>2. Poor ES leads to poor emotional health( EH). Poor EH leads to abuse of alcohol, drugs etc.</div><div><br></div><div>3. Poor ES can lead to suicide, murder, making wrong choices.</div><div>Solution to poor ES</div><div><br></div><div>1. Always try as much as possible to express your feelings in an appropriate way. When you have feelings of stress, sadness, or anxiety it's very important that you talk to someone especially your loved ones.</div><div><br></div><div>2. Calm your mind and body by listening to good inspirational musics.</div><div><br></div><div>3. Lean on your friend's. Talk to them about your problems</div><div><br></div></div>
