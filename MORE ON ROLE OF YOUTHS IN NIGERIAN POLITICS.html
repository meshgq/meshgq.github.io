No man can be a leader without the full support of the youths, if it were possible they would not be paying you to appear in their political campaigns’. The truth is these politicians they know how important we are to their course even if we are ignorant about it. Know this, the power to do and undo is in our hands. Don’t be intimidated by your uncle, brother, neighbor or friend who is aspiring for a political position, you don’t just throw your support at them because of their fallacious political campaign promises. Check their lifestyle, their morals, and their ethos. Check their background, are they credible? can they deliver ?</p><p>As a youth you are a kingmaker, you are that powerful. We are the voice of this nation, and we have to start thinking about our future and the future of our born and unborn children. What we are facing today is as a result of the mistakes our parents made. Most of us we are just interested in the now, what we can get now. What about tomorrow my fellow comrades, your future can be predicted by your actions today. The change we are craving for has to start with us because we are the future of today. The problems we have in this country are accumulated problems, there is no new problem, and our present leaders are only making it worst by not doing anything.</p><p><strong>Emmanuel Macron (39)</strong> wouldn’t have been the president of France if it was left for the “senior men” as we normally call them. The so called senior men have been toying with us for decades now. In France the kingmakers made a choice, a choice that has turned the life of the youths in France around for good. Today the whole world is talking about the brevity of the youths of France. They knew what they were up against; they were fighting for their future, the same fight that led Ken saro Wiwa to his early grave, Fela kuti and the rest.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> YOUTHS AND EDUCATION</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Education is the key to success, not just as an individual but as a nation also. Germany, the US, France, Russia, England invested in education and research in the early 1800 and they are the world power today.</p><p>Our leaders are crumbling the educational system because they know that the more people are educated, the higher the tendency for them to know their rights and stand up to them. Most of our youths are uneducated and that is a big problem. A nation is blind without sound educated youths. Take a look at the cost of education in this country, government owned universities are competing with private owned universities in terms of tuition fees. But there is a big robust difference in terms of their learning conditions. It’s so clear that the people you sold your votes to are not interested not just in your future but In the future of your born and unborn children. If that your “boss man or senior man” as we call them, in the house of assembly, senate, or representative, is interested in your future why is he not doing anything about it. The truth is they don’t CARE!</p><p><strong>David Wale Feso</strong> said “if you want to crumble a nation, kill the educational system”. And it’s so painful that we are completely ignorant about it. You see, they don’t want our eyes to be opened so that they can continue to use us like robots. They know the importance of education and that is why they are sending their children abroad to study in the best universities. If you know these things you will not carry a gun for any politician, if it’s a good thing let them send their children.</p><p>Say no to political slavery, this was what<strong> Fela  Kuti </strong>fought and died for, he knew this day will come. He saw it coming and decided to create awareness through his music. I want us to remember this line: <strong>Fela’s awareness of our problems was through education, he saw clearly through education&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p></div>
